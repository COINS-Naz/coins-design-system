## Component Variations
### Attachment types
The attachments can be either files (such as txt., pdf., xml., etc.) or photos. If photo has annotations, then we show badge overlay “Annotated”. 
Cross icon stands for the Delete file/photo option. In view mode, the cross icon is hidden.

### Attachment Module
Different states of Attachment module. When more than 1 attachment exist, the component scrolls horizontally. Component heading, if exists remains fixed with no scrolling. The component heading (Here “Attachments”) can be hidden if needed.

### Example of usage
When attachments exist and there is more than one file/photo attached, then we use the horizontal scroll. The title (here Attachments stays on the same place when attachments line including the button scroll horizontally).
