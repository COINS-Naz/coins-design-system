It connects to a range of data sources, from basic Excel spreadsheets to databases, and both cloud-based and on-premise apps."

## Overview

We use power BI charts in different parts of OA to show a vide veriety of data points using simple charts, graphs and tables. To work with Power BI you need a computer running on Windows. Power BI doesn't support Mac devices and only allows you to view and present published reports via https://app.powerbi.com/

## Colors
For designing Power BI report we use colors from Coins Global styling and Colors from OA design system.

### Indicating the state
When we need to show the difference between different trend states, we use three main colors as indicators: <br>
- Red #D82C0D for critical state
- Amber #EFA611 for warnings
- Green #2D864B for good state

### Colors for Data Legend
When the chart has a large amount of data to be displayed using different colors we use a set of colors with a certain order.

Note: Arrows indicate the order of colors to be used for charts for legibility reasons.

### Example of a Stacked Bar Chart

### Colors for background
For the background (wallpaper) we use light grey #ECEDEF.
For the background of the cards we use simple white #FFFFFF.

### Colors for text
As we use White or Light Grey for backgrounds, we want the texts to always be legible, thus we use Coins Black #2a2a2a.

## Fonts
Because Power BI does not allow you to import fonts, we cannot use a standard Coins font set (Roboto). As a replacement we use the default Segoe UI font with the following rules of usage:
### Page Header 
Use Segoe UI 16 for text in Page Header (in case if there is too much information it can be reduced).<br>
Page header should be center aligned.<br>

### Chart fonts
**Chart header** Segoe UI Semibold 11 or 12 depending on look.<br>
**XY axis title** As default we do not use it (If we use then text should be Segoe UI 10pt.<br>
**XY axis unit** Segoe UI 8.<br>
**Legend** Segoe UI 10.<br>

### Table Fonts
**Table header** Segoe UI Semibold 10. <br>
**Table Data** Segoe UI 10. <br>
**Total row** Segoe UI Semibold 10. <br>

### Fonts in Filters
**Filter title** Segoe UI Semibold 10. <br>
**Filter data** Segoe UI 9. <br>

### Text aligment
In all text areas (headers, titles, tables, etc.) we use left text aligment. In case we have single row card, or a tile with one number or small amount of data then we can use center alignement. The table title should be center alighed as well.

## Borders and corners
All graphics should have the same 1p border with rounded corners. <br>
The distance between charts should be the same. <br>

**The settings should be:** <br>
Border - 1p stroke <br>
Corner rounding - 8p <br>
Color of the border #E6E6E6 <br>

The distance between graphics should be the same to create symmetry and a clean look on the page.<br>

{% include do-dont.html 
  do-img="PBI do.png"
  do-text="The same distance between graphics."
  dont-img="PBI do not.png"
  dont-text="Random distance between the graphics."
%}
