## Overview

Dropdown menus are typically used when you have 6-15 items to choose from. They're used for navigation or command menus, where an action is initiated based on the selection.<br>
There are two different variants of dropdowns that support different kinds of functionality— Singleselect dropdown and Multiselect dropdown.
In Multiselect dropdown menu items include checkboxes to allow the user select multiple options from a list and filter. Singleselect dropdown allows only one menu item to be selected from the list.

### When to use
- When you have more than 5 options
- When a large number of familiar options are available. User can predict them easily and there is no need for him to see options side by side.
- When you have limited space to display the options.

### When not to use
- Do not use a dropdown if there are less than 5 options to choose from. In this case, use a [Radio button](../radio-button/) or [Checkbox](../checkbox/) (depending on single or multiselect choice). 
- When you need clear comparison of options and user should see them at a glance and compare them easily. Use [Radio button](../radio-button/) or [Checkbox](../checkbox/) instead as comparing and deciding about an option from a drop-down menu takes time.
- Do not use dropdown when you have more than 15 options. Let users type the same information into a text [input](../input/) that suggests possible options instead.

## Guidelines
**Labels** <br>
Use sentence case and write concise labels that clearly indicate the purpose of the selection.<br>

**Ordering of options** <br>
Sort list items in logical order, such as placing most common options first, grouping highly related options together, listing items based on size, or using alphabetical order for lists with 7 or more items to make items easier to find (for example, language or country lists). Place options that represent “All” or “None” at the beginning of the list, regardless of the sort order. Select the most relevant or most common choice on the list as a default if it is appropriate for the context. <br>

**Menu display width** <br>
The display width of the menu may exceed that of the dropdown field it is associated with to accommodate the length of the longest option value.
If the menu option value length exceeds the width of the select field, it is automatically truncated in the display once selected and the menu closes. <br>

**Placement** <br>
By default, dropdowns are placed below and aligned to the left of the element they stem from. However, when there isn’t enough space in the viewport, the dropdown should be moved above and/or be aligned to the right of the element it stems from. <br>
