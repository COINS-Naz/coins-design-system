## Overview

Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

### When to use

Use buttons to communicate actions users can take and to allow users to interact with the page. Each page should have one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons.

### When not to use

Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use [Links](../links/) when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.



## Guidelines

A button’s text label is the most important element on a button, as it communicates the action that will be performed when the user interacts with it. Buttons need to be clear and predictable.

Button labels should clearly indicate the action of the button. To provide enough context, use the {verb} + {noun} content formula on buttons except in the case of common actions like “Done”, “Close”, “Cancel”, “Add”, or “Delete”.

{% include do-dont.html 
  do-img="buttons-do.jpg"
  do-text="Use capital case for labeling buttons."
  dont-img="buttons-dont.jpg"
  dont-text="Do not use uppercase."
%}


## Type

Each button variant has a particular function and its design signals that function to the user. It is therefore very important that the different variants are implemented consistently across products, so that they message the correct actions.

<!-- Content switch -->
<!-- Content switch tab 1 -->
{% capture type-primary %}
{% include snippet.html code='
<button class="button primary" type="button">Primary</button>
' %}
{% endcapture %}

<!-- Content switch tab 2 -->
{% capture type-default %}
{% include snippet.html code='
<button class="button" type="button">Default</button>
' %}
{% endcapture %}

<!-- Render Content -->
{% include content-switch.html for="type"
           content-1-label="Primary" content-1=type-primary
           content-2-label="Default" content-2=type-default
%}
<!-- End content switch -->

| Type     | Class                                | Usage          |
|----------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| Primary  | <span class="snip">primary</span>    | For the principal call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen (not including the application header, modal dialog, or side panel). |
| Default  | –                                    | For secondary actions on each page. If paired with a primary button, the default button’s function is to perform the negative action of the set, such as “Cancel” or “Back”. |

## Size

Buttons are named according to their size and usage in the Figma UI kit and in the code. The table below adds more context around the use case for each size.

<!-- Content switch -->
<!-- Content switch tab 1 -->
{% capture size-small %}
{% include snippet.html code='
<button class="button small" type="button">Small</button>
' %}
{% endcapture %}

<!-- Content switch tab 2 -->
{% capture size-default %}
{% include snippet.html code='
<button class="button" type="button">Default</button>
' %}
{% endcapture %}

<!-- Content switch tab 3 -->
{% capture size-large %}
{% include snippet.html code='
<button class="button large" type="button">Large</button>
' %}
{% endcapture %}

<!-- Render Content -->
{% include content-switch.html for="size"
           content-1-label="Small"   content-1=size-small
           content-2-label="Default" content-2=size-default
           content-3-label="Large"   content-3=size-large
%}
<!-- End Content switch -->

| Size     | Class                                | Usage          |
|----------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| Small    | <span class="snip">small</span>      | Use as section inner page contextual action or when there is not enough vertical space for the default button. |
| Default  | –                                    | Use as primary page actions and other standalone actions. |
| Large    | <span class="snip">large</span>      | Use as top level navigation section action. |

## Adding an icon

You can include an icon inside a button. Select one from [COINS Icons](../icons/).

{% include snippet.html code='
<button class="button icon" type="button">
  <i class="icn icn-Plus"></i> Click me
</button> 
' %}

| Class                                | Usage          |
|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| <span class="snip">icon</span>       | Include an icon by adding <span class="snip">&lt;i class=&quot;icn icn-SomeIconClass&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</span> before the button label inside. |
