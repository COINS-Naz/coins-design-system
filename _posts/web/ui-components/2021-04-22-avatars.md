## Overview

Avatars can be used to represent people or objects. It supports images, Icons, or letters. Users generally upload their own image, otherwise, a default image is displayed.

## When to use

Use an avatar to help a user in the platform efficiently identify another person or an organization.  The Avatar can be used to provide navigation to a user's profile, or to associate a user with a particular set of data. 

## When not to use
Do not use avatars in grids, system pop-ups, or other places where screen space is limited. They will create visual noise and adversely affect data readability. Avoid an avatar when most people or groups won't have an image to show.

## Guidelines

**Appearance**

Always display avatars in a circle. This ensures that all users are represented equally on the user interface. Avatars should mask an image into their shape and work with any image size since they may get this image from unknown data sources.

**Size**

Avatars should be one of 2 sizes:
Small (48 × 48 px): use as the default size
Large (200 × 200 px): use when an avatar is a focal point, such as on a single customer card

## Type

It is preferable that an avatar display an image, which is is usually uploaded by a user. Images are personalized and make good use of the ability of the human brain to recognize faces. Project and group avatars contain a fallback in the case an image is not provided: 

**Avatar with initials**

When there is no personal photo to show, use initials. If the label name contains two words, like first and last name, the first letter of each will be capitalized and returned - for example, JD for Jane Doe

**Avatar with Icon**

When there is no specific individual or group identified, use the default user avatar with icon.
