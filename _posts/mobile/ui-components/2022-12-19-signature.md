### Signature Board
A signature board is a place where the user leaves a signature. It has 2 states: default and filled. (see the examples below). Filled state has two additional buttons: DONE and a trash icon to clear the signature. Trash icon (clear signature function) brings you to the default state screen. DONE saves the signature.
