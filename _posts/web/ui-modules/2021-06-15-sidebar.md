## Overview
The sidebar holds navigational components and elements. It helps users navigate between destinations and initiate key actions. Sidebar can be expanded, shorten or hidden to accommodate different app layouts.

### When to use
Use the side navigation component to let users navigate the main pages or subpages in a system or service.

### When not to use
We should NOT use this module when there are logically related but mutually exclusive sub-sections of a page. Use the [Tabs module](../tabs/) instead.

## Guidelines
**Position**
A Sidebar is an always-present 320px wide vertical content area always positioned below the header and fixed to the left. 

**Appearance**
Destinations in a sidebar take the form of actionable list items. Each item describes its destination using a text label and optional iconography. Icons can supplement labels as indicators of a destination. When used, they should always be placed before text. 
Horizontal dividers can be used to separate groups of navigation destinations within the list. They extend across the full width of the sidebar.

**Destination titles**
Keep the navigation links short. They can be shorter derivatives of page titles themselves.

  do-text="Keep text labels concise, but truncate them if they extend beyond the container width."
  dont-img="Guidelines_Sidebar_Do_Not.png"
  dont-text="Don’t shrink text size in order to fit a text label on a single line."
%}

**Behaviour**
Indicate where a user is within the navigational hierarchy. Use the “active” state to show users where they are now and “hover” state to show users which page they will be navigated to if click. As a default, the sidebar is always in expanded state with first list item active.
